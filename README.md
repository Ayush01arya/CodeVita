## Team CodeVita

We are Team CodeVita, participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024! Our project aims to create an interactive **Orrery Web App** that displays Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).

## Project Overview

An **orrery** is a mechanical model of the solar system that was first introduced to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713. Traditionally, orreries were physical models, but today we leverage modern technology to create interactive, virtual orreries with much more information and functionality.

### Challenge

Our goal is to create a dynamic, real-time web-based orrery that visualizes celestial objects and provides information on NEOs. The web app will serve as an educational tool and provide real-time data about these objects' positions and trajectories in space.

### Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Display the positions of planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can explore the solar system by rotating, zooming, and clicking on objects for more details.
- **NEO Data Integration:** Pull data from NASA's Near-Earth Object program to show up-to-date information on asteroid orbits and hazards.
- **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs):** Highlight and display information about asteroids that may pose a threat to Earth.
- **Customizable Views:** View orrery models from different perspectives (e.g., top-down, side-on, or free rotation).

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Three.js or D3.js for 3D rendering)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js for handling NEO data requests
- **API:** NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaboration

### How to Run the App

1. Clone this repository:
